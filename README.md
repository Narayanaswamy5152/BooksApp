I have build the app by following the requirements given in the assignment document.
In this i have developed a responsive app using media queries and then i have developed the functionalities like giving title input,author input and when the user submits the title input and author input by clicking the submit button then he will able to see the list of titles and authors of books.
I have also added an additional functionality of adding starred buttoned when the user thinks that the book is important he can star it when user click on starred button he can able to see only starred books.
I have also developed a delete functionality if user thinks the book is useless then he can delete the ui by clicking the delete button.
